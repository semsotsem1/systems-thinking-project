# systems-thinking-project
API prototype with metrics, load tests (500 rps), and a documented failure scenario

### Problem statement

Like many real-world systems, API-based services often run smoothly under normal conditions but can fail in unclear ways under load, partial outages and unexpected inputs.
As a newbie in systems engineering, I want to understand how failures, performance limits, and security decisions affect how a system behaves.

This project is a small API designed to explore reliability, observability and basic security trade-offs in a controlled environment.
